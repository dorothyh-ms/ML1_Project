# ML1_Project

This is a github repo for the Machine Learning 1 Final Project for the University of Antwerp Master's programme, Linguistics (Digital Text Analysis). This project aims to train classifiers with multiple sklearn machine learning algorithms to predict the price of a skincare product based on different precictors (the brand, ingredients, type, and amount of a product). The dataset for this project came from the "Skincare Products and their Ingredients on Kaggle", provided by Erin Ward, containing data from the online retailer LookFantastic.com, a website that sells skincare products.

In this repository, I have uploaded 5 Jupyter notebooks with experiments with 8 different algorithms. I also attached and a short report describing the models performance.

I used 3 parametric classifiers:

- Perceptron

- Logistic regression

- SVC

2 non-parametric classifiers:

- KNN

- Decision Tree

and 3 ensemble methods:

- Voting classifier

- Bagging

- Random forests
